                            <p>Job Search is a web application that integrates JavaScript, Vue.js, bootstrap, and Node.js. The
                                purpose of this project was to enhance my programming skills towards web development. To
                                be able to work with data that comes from rest API'S. With this application you are able to 
                                search for any kind of job that exists. After entering that job title a list of related jobs 
                                is returned indicating what job title was selected from the user. I use express to handle multiple 
                                different http requests at a specific url. And I use superagent to make get request from the backend and I use
                                axios to make get requests from the frontend.

                    <div class="description3">
                        <p>When I took Data Structures and Alogrithms I decided to create a program to help visualize which 
                            sorting alogrithm is the fastest to sort based on different sets of data. User is able to select the size of the
                            data. Numbers will represent the data and in my program I use an arraylist and the program populates the
                            arraylist with random numbers. After this is done, I make six more of copies of the arraylist that was created 
                            because each arraylist will be sorted from a different sorting algorithm. I implement seven sorting algorithms and
                            I do this by using the psuedocode of each sorting algorithm. The sorting algorithms used are: merge sort, quick sort
                            , radix sort, counting sort, insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort. I used Instant.now() to time the methods
                            of each sorting algorithm to get the time it takes for each sorting algorithm to sort the arraylist. I use the time values 
                            to graph the values. I use Java to complete this project.</p>

                    <div class="description4">
                        <p>Stack Maze Solver is a Java program to find a walkable path based on reading a text files composed multiple components.
                            The first row of the file represents the number of rows and number of columns. The second row indicates where the 
                            starting point is located. S represents the starting point and E represents the ending point. Lastly, walkable path
                            is determined by the 0's and 1's. 0 indicating not a walkable path and 1 indicating a walkable. So, I use a stack because
                            I push to the stack where there is a walkable path and then pop when there is not walkable path. This is done repetitively
                            when finding the ending point.
